Meridional ovErTurning ciRculation diagnostIC (METRIC)
======================================================

The METRIC python module enables consistent calculations of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) 
estimates at various observational arrays from ocean general circulation models. To make the most appropriate comparisons, 
the package evaluates the model meridional overturning circulation using analogous observation-style methods.
The current version allows AMOC estimates at the RAPID (26.5N) site, the MOVE (16N) site, and the SAMBA (34.5S) site. 
METRIC also includes a few additional, alternative approaches to calculate these transports.
